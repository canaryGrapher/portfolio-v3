My portfolio is a mix of personal experiments and professional projects I've delivered with teams across industries. Whether it's a sleek web app, a backend service, or a full-stack product, each project reflects my passion for building things that make an impact. Technology keeps evolving, and so do I. This is not just a portfolio â€” it's a story in progress, one project at a time."
